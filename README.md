gRPC is a high performance Remote Procedure Call framework that can efficiently connect services in and across data centers with pluggable support for load balancing, tracing, health checking and authentication.

The main benefits of gRPC are:
Modern, high-performance, lightweight RPC framework.
Contract-first API development, using Protocol Buffers by default, allowing for language agnostic implementations.
Tooling available for many languages to generate strongly-typed servers and clients.
Supports client, server, and bi-directional streaming calls.
Reduced network usage with Protobuf binary serialization.
